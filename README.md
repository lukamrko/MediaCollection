![modal-showcase](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41a3fb1e-e735-449d-b133-85cd607cf8a0)

Basic idea behind app is for user to be able work with media he has seen or plans to see. At one moment user will be able to add multiple different medias, like movies or books, and there will also be a different types of filter methods.

Things that have yet to be done:

Frontend:
- Add possibility of updating rows
- Add possibility of deleting rows
- Add modals for information/warning

Possible additional frontend stuff:
- Add search/filter options
- Clean up the code
-   Example is to unify the way that api is called
- Add tests?
- Pretifiy this mess


Backend:
- Make application async
- Return results instead of just void
- Add tests
- Add CORS via configuration

  TODO:
  Add instructions on how to run the app
